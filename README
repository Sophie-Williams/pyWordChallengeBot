Name: 		pyWordChallengeBot
Version:	0.1
Platform: 	Mac OS X


This script will allow you to cheat in the game WordChallenge on Facebook (http://apps.facebook.com/wordchallenge).

It requires Python, and currently runs only on Mac OS X. If you would like to make it work on other platforms, then please fork on github and contribute.


To use:
	
	In the terminal, type 'python pyWordChallengeBot'
	Then, to solve a normal jumble, type '1' followed by the jumble, ie "--> 1 telret"
	Now you need to quickly switch to Firefox (or w/e browser you are using), and make sure the flash applet is active. It 	won't work otherwise
	To quit, type "quit", ie "->> quit"
	For FB friend solving functionality, look below


The bot is also able to solve friend's names (the bonus levels in the game).
For this to work, you will need your own API KEY and SECRET, as I don't want to give you my own, as it's not safe.
Some instructions on how to do this are here (http://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-acquire-your-facebook-api-key.html).
When you have your API_KEY and SECRET, simply change them in the top of the script file.
Also, you will need to uncomment two lines in the main function, or it won't work.
You will also need pyFacebook from here (http://github.com/sciyoshi/pyfacebook)
